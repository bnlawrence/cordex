Tools for playing with regional climate model data

Yes, there are other tools, but you have to learn by playing.

Minimal is a minimal working example of what appears to be [a definition problem](https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy/issues/2091).

Currently `plotters.py` just makes a nice plot of a few CORDEX domains (those defined in `domains.py`) using cf-python and the cf-domain definition.

If you want to do real work, you could look at [py-cordex](https://py-cordex.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
